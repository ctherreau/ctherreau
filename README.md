My name is Chloe Therreau.

For almost 5 years, I have been immersed in data through my academic and professional career. It started during my PhD in particle physics (Nantes University) and continued as an R&D engineer in optical simulations.

After developing further my skill in data analysis thanks to an intensive bootcamp at Le Wagon, I am now seeking new opportunities as a data scientist. I am looking forward to use my analytical skills, scientific background and enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making to contribute to the success of an innovative organization.


In my free time, I like to explore the world, hike with my dog, play to the Legend of Zelda and watch TV shows.
