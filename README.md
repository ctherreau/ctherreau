My name is Chloe Therreau.

Over the past six years, I have gained extensive experience in the field of data through my academic and professional journey. First, during my doctoral studies in particle physics, then as a R&D engineer specialised in optical simulations.

Having further developed my data analysis skills thanks to an intensive bootcamp, I am now seeking new opportunities as a data analyst. 

I am looking forward to use my analytical skills, scientific background and enthusiasm for data-driven decision-making to contribute to the success of an innovative organization.


In my spare time, I like to explore the world, go hiking with my dog, play The Legend of Zelda and watch TV series.
